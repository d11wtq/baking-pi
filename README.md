# Baking Pi

This is just a toy project, implementing a basic operating
system for Raspberry Pi, as per [Baking Pi](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os)
though with some divergences, for exploratory purposes.

No further documentation, since it's not intended for
anybody to actually try and run this themselves.
